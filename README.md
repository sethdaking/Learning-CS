🚀 Learning Computer Science in Public
Welcome to my open notebook, sandbox, and war journal as I dive headfirst into the world of Computer Science — from zero. No formal degree. Just grit, curiosity, and caffeine.

💡 Why this repo?
Because watching tutorials and not building shit got old.
This is where I actually learn — by doing, failing, and figuring it out one “aha” at a time.

📚 What you’ll find:
🧠 Simple, human-friendly notes (not textbook nightmares)

🔨 Mini projects to turn theory into muscle memory

📈 Progress logs — raw, real, and full of facepalms

🧪 Experimentation with real-world CS concepts

🧭 Topics I'm Exploring:
Data Structures & Algorithms

Systems & Low-Level Programming

Problem Solving & Coding Challenges

CS Fundamentals: from OS to Networking

Projects that turn theory into fire

🫡 Who's this for?
Self-taught devs tired of tutorial hell

Students who want the real version, not the filtered one

Anyone who loves watching a transformation in real-time

⚔️ Join the journey
You can watch, fork, or follow along.
Or just steal the code and pretend it’s yours — I won’t snitch 😎

Let's turn confusion into clarity — one repo at a time.
